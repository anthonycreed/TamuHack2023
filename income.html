            <h1>Income: What is it?</h1>
            <p>Income is the money that people make by working. For example, when you grow up, 
               you might get a job and make money by working. At a younger age, your income could be an
               allowance that you receive from your parents from doing chores around the house, from family 
               members on holidays, or money that you obtained from a lemonade stand. That money is called your 
               income. </p>

            <p>Income is important because it helps people buy things they need or want, like food, games, clothing,
               and a place to live. </p>
