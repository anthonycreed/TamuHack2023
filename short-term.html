                <p class="shorttext">
                    Short - Term Wants and Needs are things that people want or need right now or in the near future.
                    <br>
                    For example, if you are hungry right now, food is a short-term need. You need to eat something soon in order to be healthy.

                    A short-term want might be getting a new toy or game you've been wanting. You might really want it, but you don't need it to survive, 
                    even if your best friends have it right when it comes out!

                    It's important to understand the difference between wants and needs because sometimes people have different amounts of income, 
                    so they have to make choices about what to spend it on. Needs are more important than wants and should be a person's focus. 
                    For example, it is important to have a roof over your head and food to eat before buying a new game.
